# Cat and Mouse Game
This is a cat and mouse game built on Java. 

## About the game
The cat chases the mouse with a clever breadth-first search algorithm to find the best path. The player scores points by avoiding the cat for 5 seconds, in which case the board resets. However, being caught be the cat will result in a deduction of points.
